**TL;DR** — Applying our MVBO algorithm in a systems optimization context, specifically to deploy with a new (greenfield) solar array control system, running in both live/production and shadow/simulated settings.


### Top-level requirements

*links to full product requirements doc (and the R&D requirements doc if applicable from earlier levels)*

1. The CRS model shall run efficiently and reliably as a module in the broader industrial control system.
2. The optimization module shall continuously validate and deploy both production and shadow instances.
3. The CRS algorithm and broader optimization module shall test for, be robust against, and log and shifts in data, environment, or other operations.
4. The control system optimzation scheme shall be resilient to faults and intrusions (internally and externally).
5. The optimization module shall have a total runtime less than 5% of the end-to-end control software pipeline.
6. The optimization module shall have a fallback/bypass mode in case of unforseen failure.

**Extra notes**: More product requirements for the specific customer deployments and/or distribution channels, not listed here in the interest of space.


### Model / algorithm info


![Alt text](example-BO-flowchart.png?raw=true "Solar array optimization flowchart")


**Extra notes**: See previous Cards for details on MVBO


### Intended use

Closed-loop contrained optimization of industrial control system that operates the positioning (i.e. actuation) of solar panels in a given array/field. Extensive V&V testing must be done in simulation with real data and synthetic data prior to live deployment.

**Extra notes**: At this advanced MLTRL stage there should be product datasheet/whitepaper that elucidates the use-cases.

### Testing status

The following should be implemented and running (with visible status indicators and continuous logs):

1. CI/CD test suite implementation and status page
2. Cyber-physical systems tests for device and network bandwiths/latencies
3. Optimization module's shadow testing suite
4. Optimization module's testing suite for environment/data shifts


### Data considerations

Production data should be assumed to be specific to each deployment / environment, even with our domain randomization techniques. This also holds for the synthetic datasets, which are generated based on a limited set of real data.


### Caveats, known edge cases, recommendations

In very rare cases that we've only seen in (intentionally challenging) simualted scenarios, the optimization module will try to shift half the solar field m degrees and the other half n degrees, and then back again on the next control loop. Simply adding random noise to several of the actuators eliminates this scenario without affecting performance metrics.

### MLTRL stage debrief

<!-- Succinct summary of stage progress – please respond to each question, link to extended material if needed... -->

1. What was accomplished, and by who?

    Containerization and integrastion of the optimization subsystem into a production-ready software module.

2. What was punted and/or de-scoped?

    n/a

3. What was learned?

Increasing the number of runs increases the robustness of the results

4. What tech debt what gained? Mitigated?

A better optimizer may improve the performance of our model
